## Introduction to TensorFlow

Basic TensorFlow linear regression notes

This is a simple notebook to confirm my understanding on how TensorFlow works. I will do simple example with a univariate linear regression with numerical derivations. 

### Hypothesis function, h(x)
y = mx



### Starting parameter / Initial hypothesis 
m = 0 <br>


### Target Parameter / Goal
m = 1

### Dataset 
(-3,3), (-2,-2), (-1, -1), (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

### Loss function
Square loss function<br>

### Optimizer 
Gradient descent with $\alpha = 0.0001 $


We will also stop after one epoch and compare our calculated weight update with TensorFlow's to confirm our expectation. 

Note: This is using TensorFlow 1.x.
